# PeaPods: A python library for simulating spin systems

The goal of this project is to build a Python library for simulating spin systems with modern efficient Monte-Carlo methods. The implementation aims to balance between performance and simplicity. 

Currently, only Ising ferromagnets and spin-glasses are supported, but development for other spin classes (Potts, clock, and O(N) models) are planned, including their quantum counterparts.

## Dependencies (numba)

The required dependencies should come with any standard Python installations. However, it is highly recommended that you install Numba for efficient simulation. Simply create a new python environment and do:

`pip install numba`
