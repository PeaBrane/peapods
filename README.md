# PeaPods: A python library for simulating spin systems

The goal of this project is to build a comprehensive framework in Python for
simulating spin systems with modern efficient Monte-Carlo methods. The 
implementation aims to balance between performance (for both development 
and usage) and simplicity. 

Currently, only Ising ferromagnets and spin-glasses are supported, but development
for other spin classes (Potts, clock, and O(N) models) are planned, including
their quantum counterparts.

This is an open-source project, so everyone is welcomed to contribute! Please
